### Project Premise: create a table dynamically based upon a dataset we provide - needs to allow users to filter the table data for specific values using only pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages.

1. Create a basic HTML web page

2. Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting

3. Use a date form in the HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input
